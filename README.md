Musicly's Mode.ify is a web app designed for musicians to write more complex chords and progesssions, making their music more interesting, and invoke more emotion.

The main feature is a piano that can be played on your computer keyboard, with a chord builder and chord progression builder, and several suggestion modes that suggest more complex chords, or chords that fit within the key you're in.

## Inspiration

Music theory is HARD. There are over 4,000 recognized chords before we even get into voicings. There are 168 scales to choose from. This leads to a nearly infinite number of possibilities, yet we tend to hear a lot of the same chord progressions again and again.  Mode-ify helps musicians break out of the norm by offering more complex chords, and chord suggestions to go along with other selected chords. Have fun, and explore!

## Instructions

Once opening the app, users will see several options - click on Mode-ify. This is the name of the chord & progression builder application. 

Users will be instantly met by a piano keyboard that maps to their computer keyboard. There is a sound drop down with more than 120 sounds available to play, I recommend sticking with piano for chords.

As keys are pressed, the note will play, and be shown both on the piano as well as in the Current Notes section at the top. You can pause the current notes by pressing the "pause chord" button, or pressing the SHIFT key which will play back the last note to confirm it is paused. 

As any of the 4,000+ recognized chords are played, it will show up in green at the top, and users can enter Magic Mode by clicking "Pause Chord" and then "Make Magic" OR by simply pressing the ENTER key.

Once in Magic Mode users will be shown the key, current chord, and exploration options like Current Chord Extensions, as well as Major and Minor Suggestions.

Any chord can be added to or removed from the progression builder to see how selected chords work together. 

The scale drop down is filtered to show ONLY scales that contain ALL of the notes in the selected chord, so users can browse scale options, and get even more chord suggestions based on the scale they select. 

HAVE FUN!
